#### What you'll learn in this lesson:

- ðŸŒŸ LLM completions and chat flows
- ðŸ”— Functions & plugins with LLMs
- ðŸ”Ž Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ðŸ‘€ Vision-based AI approaches
- ðŸ”Š Audio creation and transcription
- ðŸ§© Agents & assistants

For this lesson, we will subdivide the content into the following sections:

- [Chat, LLM completions, and function calling](./02.lm-completions-functions.md)
- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](./03.retrieval-augmented-generation.md)
- [Vision and audio AI applications](./05.vision-audio.md)
- [Agents](./04.agents.md)

Starting with Language Model completions and Chat applications and function implementations with language models in .NET.
